--try considering only NOUNS (part of speech data included in training data, and can use spacy for new test data)
--considering sentence context (verbs and associated nouns, we would use spacy for this)
--handling words that would not be found in a model or dictionary (because if that's the case, it's pretty likely it's a word of interest)
--possibly of NN


notes for write-up
--time/space complexity for using actual word embeddings, etc.
--can try to compare with spacy and provided test set
--implementing sentence context and how we would do that (verbs and prepositions)
--how to handle words not in word vector model?
